# The What and Why of TypeScript
  TypeScript is a "superset" to JavaScript and a programming language that builds up on JavaScript. The core language is still JavaScript and how it is wrote dose not change but TypeScript just mearly adds more fetures to JS syntax. The most important thing is that TypeScript adds **static typing** to JavaScript. 

  With TypeScript you can add type annotations ** : ** behind the parameter to show exactly what type wanted. Example :

  function add ( a: number, b: number)

  It will also alert you if the numbers you are trying to use to add are strings then it will have to adjust it to just a number. In doing so it will allow you to write more accurtate code and be able to catch mistakes before running the code.
