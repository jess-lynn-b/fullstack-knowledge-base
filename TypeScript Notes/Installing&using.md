# Installing & Using TypeScript
  Make sure to download and install it to use in VS Code. Also had to copy the link and past it in ther terminal to get the packages to run .json.
  Now that they are installed we need invoke the TypeScript complier. This will help to extend the JavaScript syntax with the extra types from the TypeScript. Important reminder that TS will not run in the browser and will need to complie TS to JS.

  During this process of complieing the type annotations will be removed bc JS does not know them. However this is where we will see possible errors before we run the code. Thus allows you to write better code and more accurate the first time. 

  To envoke the complier we must run this command ** npx tsc ** in the terminal. However you have to have a configuration file for it to go to so instead run this code. This is slightly modified... npx tsc with 'file selected to run'.
